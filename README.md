# 3DTo2DProjectionCoppelia
Simulate 3D to 2D projection in CoppeliaSim with the focal length method. Convert points for computer vision and virtual environments. Easy integration, practical demos, and contributions welcome.

## Description:
This repository provides an implementation in CoppeliaSim for the calculation of 3D to 2D projection using the focal length method. The goal is to transform three-dimensional points into two-dimensional pixel coordinates, simulating the projection process in a virtual camera. The method takes into account the camera's focal length to compute pixel coordinates corresponding to 3D points, crucial in various applications such as computer vision and virtual environment simulations.

## Features:

- Implementation of 3D to 2D projection calculation in CoppeliaSim.
- Practical demonstration with examples of 3D points converted into 2D pixel coordinates.
- Detailed documentation explaining the calculation method, parameters, and usage.

## Usage Instructions:

    Clone the repository into your CoppeliaSim development environment.
    Use the provided scripts and examples to integrate the projection calculation into your own projects.
    Refer to the documentation for a better understanding of parameters and available adjustments.
